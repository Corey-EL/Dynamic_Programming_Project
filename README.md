# Dynamic_Programming_Project
## Corey Lang

## Project Overview

This coding project was to compare three ways to solve the fibonacci problem and matrix chain problem.
-      (1) straight recursive approach
-      (2) memoized top-down approach
-      (3) bottom-up approach

## Tachnologies Used

- Python
- Time library
- Pandas 
- Dataframes
- Dynamic Programming approaches (Recursive, Memoized top-down, and Bottom-up)
